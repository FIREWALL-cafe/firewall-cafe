A month-long Pop-Up Internet Cafe, FIREWALL is a socially engaged research and interactive art installation designed to foster public dialogue about Internet freedom. The goal of this art project is to investigate online censorship by comparing the disparities of Google searches in the U.S.A. versus Baidu searches in China.
